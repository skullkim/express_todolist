## folders<br>  
1. models: sequelize files
2. passport: files to passport works properly, such as strategy
3. public: client-side java script files
4. routes: routers
5. views: html and nunjucks files

## running<br>
I ignored .env and config.json file about sequelize. So you need to make these files before run this toDoList.
